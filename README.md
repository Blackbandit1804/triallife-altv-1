# Introduction

## Summary

This project solely exists as a new standard for GTA 5 roleplay scripts on the [alt:V](https://altv.mp/) client. The Trial Life Roleplay Script for GTA 5 has type safety through TypeScript and a solid foundation for what is considered core for a Roleplay server.
Below you will find a [list of features](#Feature-List-Work-in-Progress) which came with this framework.

You will have to do some general script writing and know Javascript or Typescript to fully understand what this script has to offer. The script itself takes some of the harder pieces of writing a roleplay script for GTA 5 and makes them more accessible.

This is a framework and not a out-of-the-box full-featured script. This framework aims to provide the bare minimum necessary to help you get your server running at a much faster rate.
