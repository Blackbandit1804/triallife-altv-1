## Do you have a Roadmap?

No. Unfortunately a Roadmap is determined based on the needs of the main developer. If there is a need for reduced build times, the main developer will work on increasing build times. If there is a need for a phone system, the phone system will be written. It's all dependent on the origin of a problem and what needs to be done to reach a solution for that specific problem.

## What happens after Trial Life stops development?

The script becomes fully open source and the bootup instructions are released publicly for everyone to gain access. However, this project will likely see at least 1 month of on-going development, performance improvements, and pushing for increased ease-of-use.

## Server Specification Recommendations

You do not need a ton of RAM for a GTA:V server. Make sure you're not overdoing it. I've seen large player cap servers paying for 64GB of RAM which is completely unnecessary.

```
- 2 Cores
- 3+ GHz Processor
- 8GB - 16GB of RAM
- Unmetered Incoming Bandwidth
- Unmetered Outgoing Bandwidth
- SSD 100GB~
- Anti-DDoS Service
```

## Interfaces are sometimes laggy or delayed.

Turn down your MSAA in your graphics settings. It apparently happens depending on your graphics card. Turning MSAA down to x2 instead of x4 or x8 instantly fixes this issue. It's a strange bug that alt:V has but nobody has a lead on.

## Do I have to use Discord?

If you wish to use a whitelist and some other features then the answer is yes. However, you may remove the Discord based login and you will have to make a large amount of changes to unhook the Discord Authentication service.
